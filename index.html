    <article class="about">
        My name is Justin Martinez, I am currently 20 years old and im a student at the coding boot camp at the University of Charlotte North Carolina. Taking those first steps is never easy but as we all know they are absolutley crucial to be sucessful in any feild. Even some of the best developers never knew how to right a single line of code at some point. Taking this boot camp is a big stepping point for me and for the career ive always dreamed of having, Learning and taking in all this new information is definetly not going to happen over night but through practice and enough commitment maybe ill get to the point of being a "pro". Learning new tools and skills to help expand my skills and better my coding.

    <article class="work1">In this case i was tasked to refactor code that was made for this website without changing any features or changing the look of the webpage at all. I was able to replace alot of div tags with html semantic tags to organize the code more and give it a user freindly look with easily being able to find code based for a certain section.</article>
